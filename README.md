# pairs_of_primeno
Print all pairs (sets) of prime numbers (p,q) such that p*q <= n, where n is given number.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T testcases follow.
The first line of each test case is N.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the all pairs of prime numbers in increasing order.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
4 ≤ N ≤ 400
